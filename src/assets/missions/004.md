> The Blackfin Division has been increasing the armed forces around the drop point, and a mass of cargo shippments have been transported to the excavation site. A whistleblower has gone public with information that the containers contained large ammounts of explosives which is being transported down into the drop point site. Jenna Red has been sent to oversee the operations, many of the previous site overseers have disappeared. Though recently large protest have been happening within the Drop Point crew, and workers are refusing to decend down into the site because of rumors of a 'monster' running rampant down there. The Blackfin Division's main method of contacting the Orbital Eye has been disabled as long as the access to the Drop Point site is unavailable, but they are working activly to re-establish control of the station.
