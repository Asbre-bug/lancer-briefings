After the attack on the Blackfin Division Maglev Train, the servers that were contained on the high speed train was breached, and all the information stored there was relocated to a unknown repository. Days later, the files were released on the local Doppler-14 omninet available for anyone to access. All the information gathered by the Blackfin Division about various state and non-state actors has been made public domain. It is still not known who performed the attack, and released the files. Groups such as the 'Badgers' and the 'Munnin's Jailers' have claimed they were behind it, but nothing has been confirmed yet.

In the files extencive information about the Blackfin's Division illegal projects and actions have been brought to the surface. Including the bombing of Malran, and the surface of the Tesser region 30 years ago. The conflict that was started 30 years ago was believed to be initiated by the Union, but with the information on found on the servers it has come into light that this was a fase flag operation orchestrated by the Blackfin Division.
